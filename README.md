Judgementalist â€” judge Sherlock contests faster

https://www.loom.com/share/7bab4a0351e742de8b29b091d742b82f

## Overview

Judgmentalist helps you judge Sherlock contests faster by eliminating the cumbersome task of managing multiple markdown files and taking notes on Google spreadsheets. 

Simply run `npx judgmentalist` in your judging repository and review all the issues related to the contest on your browser. You can then review each issue one by one, assigning severity rankings and making notes as needed.


## Usage

```
npx judgementalist
```

## Key Features

- Local Development: This will run on your local machine, as judging contests should be confidential between Watsons
- Severity Assignment: This allows users to assign the severity to each issue
- Duplicates Detection: If you come across a duplicate issue, it can be easily identified and managed
- Issue Handling: Mark issues for further review if you're unsure and want to revisit it later
- Best Issue Recognition: Mark the best issue with a star so that it can be automatically selected for a report
- Automatic File Renaming: When you're done, hit the rocket button to automatically move and rename all your files following Sherlock's requirements
