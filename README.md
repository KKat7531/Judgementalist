Judgementalist â€” judge Sherlock contests faster

![screenshot-2023-05-16-19-34-17](https://github.com/aviggiano/judgementalist/assets/3029017/abe5a366-8651-4bd5-a170-a448949a2a4f)

## Overview

Judgmentalist helps you judge Sherlock contests faster by eliminating the cumbersome task of managing multiple markdown files and taking notes on Google spreadsheets. Simply run `npx judgmentallist` in your judging repository and review all the issues related to the contest on your browser. You can then review each issue one by one, assigning severity rankings and making notes as needed.

## Usage

```
npx judgementalist
```

## Key Features

- Local Development: This will run on your local machine, as judging contests should be confidential between Watsons
- Severity Assignment: This allows users to assign the severity to each issue
- Duplicates Detection: If you come across a duplicate issue, it can be easily identified and managed
- Issue Handling: Mark issues for further review if you're unsure and want to revisit it later
- Best Issue Recognition: Mark the best issue with a star so that it can be automatically selected for a report
- Automatic File Renaming: When you're done, hit the rocket button to automatically move and rename all your files following Sherlock's requirements

## Contribute

PRs are welcome!

Here are some specific areas where your help would make a big difference:

- Automated Issue Similarity Detection: using pattern matching to suggest issues that are similar so that they can be automatically marked as duplicates
- Automated Rating for Invalid Submissions: automatically rating submissions that don't meet certain criteria. For example, Sherlock marks "centralization risk" as `false`, so it could automatically discard those issues.
- Filesystem Database Improvement: migrating from a `db.json` filesystem database to a DBMS
